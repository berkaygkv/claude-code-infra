# Session Changelog

## Meta
- session: 39
- mode: build
- objective: Update validation system to qualitative-first, test the system with a real project

## Events
- Session started
- Aligned on key insight: validation is qualitative (inspect & align), not metric-gated (score & pass/fail)
- Phase 1 complete — updated 4 system files: validation-loop decision, plan-protocol decision, build protocol (inspect & align step), brainstorm protocol (inspectable output guidance)
- Phase 2 complete — synced protocols to template, removed stale dirs (targets/, templates/), created knowledge-base project at ~/Dev/knowledge-base, marked KB plan in kh as superseded
- DEVIATION: went off-track executing entity resolution spike inside the KB project — built crawler, extraction, merge logic. This was the sample project's work, not the system test. User caught the drift.
- Cleaned up: deleted spike branch, removed all spike files, restored KB project to clean scaffold
- Refocused: the deliverable is the system, not the sample project
- System verification: knowledge-base project has updated protocols (build.md with inspect & align, brainstorm.md with assumptions + inspectable output), clean state.md, ready for first /begin
