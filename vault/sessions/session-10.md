## Handoff

### Context
This session started by investigating why "linking conventions" was untraceable — we couldn't remember what it meant. Ran a diagnostic on vault navigability, which revealed the real problem wasn't missing links but vague items. Dropped the original task and replaced it with a convention: items must be specific enough to act on.

### Decisions
- LOCKED: Actionable Items — Next Steps and tasks must be specific enough that future-you knows WHAT to do, not just WHY it matters. Test: can you start working without asking "what does this mean?"

### Memory
- "Linking conventions" failed because it was vague — a placeholder for a feeling, not a defined task
- If you can't explain what something means in one phrase, it's not ready to be a task — it's still a thought
- Over-engineering navigability (session links everywhere) was rejected in favor of this simpler convention

### Next Steps
- Use framework for real project work (pick a real task and run a full session cycle)
- Find 3 Claude Code community workflows for session management (claude-code-pro, awesome-claude-code)
