## Handoff

### Context
Short utility session focused on improving user prompting capabilities. User identified that they often use vague terms that don't capture their precise intent when instructing Claude. Created a comprehensive prompt dictionary as a personal reference document.

### Decisions
- No LOCKED decisions this session
- OPEN: Dictionary is a living document — user may add more entries over time

### Memory
- Prompt dictionary lives at `notes/reference/prompt-dictionary.md`
- Dictionary is for user's personal reference only — not loaded into Claude context
- User wants to communicate like "a manager with excellent communication skills and software development mind"

### Next Steps
- Continue with active tasks from runbook (Build mode structure, starter kit, system prompt)
- User may add more entries to prompt dictionary as patterns emerge
