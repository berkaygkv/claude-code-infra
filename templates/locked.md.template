# Locked Decisions

> Committed decisions for the {{PROJECT_NAME}} project. High bar to change — requires proof or strong reason to unlock.

## Target

Define your project target here.

## LOCK/UNLOCK Protocol

### When to LOCK

A decision qualifies for LOCK when **3+ criteria** apply:

- [ ] **Consequential** — Affects multiple components or future decisions
- [ ] **Debated** — We considered alternatives and chose this one
- [ ] **Costly to reverse** — Changing later would require significant rework
- [ ] **Understood** — Both parties can articulate why this is the right choice

If only 1-2 apply → keep as OPEN, not LOCKED.

### When to UNLOCK

UNLOCK requires one of:

- [ ] **New evidence** — Information we didn't have when we locked
- [ ] **Contradiction** — The decision conflicts with something else we locked
- [ ] **Failure** — We tried it and it demonstrably doesn't work

**Procedure:**
1. State which criterion applies and why
2. Discuss alternative
3. If agreed, update decision + append `(unlocked from [[session-N]], re-locked [[session-M]])` to source
